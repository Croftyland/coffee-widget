## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start server.js`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.



**Note:**

If you want to enter **coffee-widget**, in browser input need to print such directory [http://localhost:9000/chat.html](http://localhost:9000/chat.html)

This project has bugs which I wish to fix. 

It will work correctly if there will be only one input-form in:
 - public/chat.html,
 - public/joinWs.js, 
 
 ```need to comment coffeeSuggest || coffeeMaker in 7-8 lines ```

 ```need to comment function confirmSuggest || function coffeeMaker in 72 or 79 lines ```

 - server.js
